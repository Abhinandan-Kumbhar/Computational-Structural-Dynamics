# Performed structural dynamics analysis using Generalized mode acceleration method (GMAM)
<!--- ## Summary --->
<!--- Performed structural dynamic analysis of a strcuture by implementiing generalized mode acceleration method in MATLAB and improved results of mode displacement method.--->
## Resume point and it's proof
### Reduced error norm by 62% as compared to solution of mode displacement method by implementing Third order GMAM algorithm
### Reduced errornorm by 62% in result of mode displacement method by implementing 3rd orderGMAM, calibrated it withNewmark-Beta integration
<ins>**Proof**</ins>  
Refer to page no 12:  
The error norm in mode displacement method i.e. 0th order GMAM (refer to page 8) is **1.97e-8**  
The error norm in 3rd order GMAM is **0.736e-8**  
Therefore, reduction in error is **(1.97-0.736)/1.97 = 0.62**
